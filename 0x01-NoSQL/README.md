# NoSQL

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a term used to describe a category of database management systems that are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and do not rely on the traditional SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. NoSQL databases are used for various purposes, including handling large volumes of data, supporting real-time applications, and providing flexibility in data modeling. There are several key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

Data Model:

SQL databases are relational and use tables with rows and columns to store data. Data must adhere to a predefined schema.
NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They allow for flexible and dynamic data structures.
Schema:

SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data (table schema) must be defined before data can be inserted.
NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible, allowing you to insert data without a predefined schema. This flexibility is particularly useful for handling evolving data structures.
Query Language:

SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.
NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages or APIs specific to their data model. For example, MongoDB uses a query language similar to JSON, while Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language).
Scalability:

SQL databases typically scale vertically by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single server.
NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes. This is useful for handling big data and high-traffic applications.
